# Rifampicin-Clopidogrel-DDI
Modeling of published clinical Rifampicin-Clopidogrel-DDI studies for model evaluation

## Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a PK-Sim project file containing simulations of all published clinical studies used to evaluate the predictive performance of the clopidogrel model regarding the rifampicin-clopidogrel-DDI, including the respective observed data digitized from literature reports. The applied rifampicin model has been published previously [[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30091221/)]. For further details and documentation please refer to [[2](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/14/5/915)].

## Version information

PK-Sim Version 9.1.
